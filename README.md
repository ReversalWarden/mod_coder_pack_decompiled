# mod_coder_pack_decompiled
This Mod Coder Pack has been already decompiled and also Bugs fixed.(Includes Optifine!)


# Note
I do not own Optifine or find the src and I certainly don't own MCP, so please give credit to Hexeption and the devs of MCP. I just want to help out the lazy people. 



# Contact

If there are still bugs that I did not fix feel free to dm on my new Discord account, because my old one got hacked. Opposite#6550 and I don't give coding tutorials either, so don't ask me on how to setup an Event System or Gui System there are tutorials for that and you should know how to do it yourself.
